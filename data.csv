Be it ambience, food, drinks or music, Club Cabana gets a thumbs up in all departments. A swimming pool and Jacuzzi are major crowd-pullers, and its brightly neon-lit, multi-levelled dance floors are irresistible, to say the least."

The music scene here switches from retro classics to the latest international hits."
5,Palolem-Agonda Road,Leopard Valley,"Think Goa and wilderness. Leopard Valley makes the most of this deadly combo—lasers, lights, DJ’s and a massive sound system in the middle of a jungle is an experience to cherish for a lifetime. The club is one of the biggest open-air arenas in India for music and party lovers who like to revel under the starlit night."

7,Calangute,The Pine Shack,"When in Goa, do as the Goans do! Unwind yourself at a beach shack and see the place coming to life as the sun goes down. Although you will find good food and music at every other corner in Goa, shack parties have their own breezy charm. If partying in a crowd is not your thing, head to The Pine Shack to have a mini private party with your friends. Bonus: You can have a bonfire or a beachside barbeque to spice things up!"
